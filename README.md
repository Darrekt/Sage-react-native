# Sage

A well-being app that helps users focus and remain productive. Shipped as a PWA on web, with React Native implementations for iOS and Android.

## Future Work

- Margins are all hardcoded, need to use [responsive library](https://github.com/marudy/react-native-responsive-screen#example)
- Remove password-based sign-ins
  - Email link
  - Providers (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc)
- Prod notifications when they leave the app
- Add snapshot testing
- Browser extension
  - Block blacklisted sites during interval
- Release on iOS and Android Play stores
  - Privacy policy
  - Store page listing
  - Assets (Hire a designer)

## Todos and bugs

- Alert for asking permissions, pre-empt the user that the app needs to restart
- Back button should minimise modal, not close app
- Filters should be per-session
- Todo completion should be per-session so multiple devices dont give it more laps
- Dropdown deadlines with todos (RNE accordion)
- Password reset

## Proposed Features

- Fitting to individual users maximum attention
- Breaking down large tasks (by time) into smaller periods
  - Teach them to chop projects up into subtasks
- Measurement? Is the user over/underestimating?
  - How many tasks do you successfully set and complete?
- Build in feedback to test for
  - Usability
  - Retention
  - Efficacy

## Misc

- Goal and progress visualised right away
- Consistent and timed reinforcement
- "Source" Trigger
- Success-built progression to task and goal completion
